Getting used to the daytime track's heightened pace will definitely require more coffee though. Hearing that the course is designed such that a student is truly incapable of getting 100% was intimidating, as were the accounts from the fellow students who attested to that being true. I still want to get 100% though! I'm gonna be one of those students in the fourth or fifth week with chunks of hair missing from their head if I don't let that go though, and it sounds like my perfectionist side will be broken one way or another anyway. Today's assignments were pretty simple. Overall not a bad first day."

The assignment involving the fibonacci and lucas statements were actually pretty fun. Testing using pytest was incredibly simple and seeing the tests turn green when everything passed was surprisingly satisfying. As someone who likes to test through code extensively, being introduced to pytest was definitely valuable for me personally as it creates an easy way to ensure code works as intended and from every possible angle."

The amount of time spent in order to accomplish what I perceived as pretty simplistic coding tasks led me to remember the podcasts we listened to in our prework regarding impostor syndrome. I'm also still kind of confused as to what pseudocode is. It's code, but more like placeholder code for general structure and formatting purposes?"

                    "body": "I feel like today the simplicity of Python began to sink in a bit more. The goal of writing good Python code is to produce code that is easy to read and easy to follow, which is contrary to the idea I've been holding that good code is produced when you can write it in as few lines as possible. Python is centered around clarity. The assignment for today has, again, taken a very long time. Definitely a challenge."

Having to write code that executes simple tasks (removing certain characters from strings, creating new values out of given input, etc.) has significantly increased my confidence in wielding python as a constructive tool. I only wish I had known about code wars before this class! I honestly think doing at least some small amount of code wars should be added to the Code Fellows curriculum as a whole."

Learning when to stop and ask for help is quickly becoming a valuable skill. I'm beginning to adapt to this daytime track as well, which is nice. Operating off of very little sleep isn't as hard to do as previously thought."

I got an unexpected rush while trying to solve the challenge, and after completing the initial challenge I was hungry to solve the next one. I was elated, and very grateful my lab partner had the same drive to work up until lunch if it meant completing every challenge. Working on sockets felt more tedious today if I'm going to be honest. I understand that we need to feel the pain before we can truly appreciate building a server with some kind of framework, but the knowledge that I'll most likely never have to actually build one from scratch makes this assignment hard to swallow. I'm going to my first meetup tomorrow so I'm pretty excited about that."

The queue was more difficult to implement than I thought it would be. Also kinda bummed I didn't go to the Python meetup tonight. I heard it was programming night, which would not have been a good time to try and network, so I decided to stay and continue working instead."

I would've liked if there was no final http server assignment to do today as that time could've been spent cleaning up any prior assignments for our http-server and data-structures submissions, but I still appreciate that there at least wasn't another data-structure assignment to do today. I'm glad to be done with the servers! I'm looking forward to finally leaving Code Fellows and sleeping for, eh, probably like 2 days straight. I'm also stoked to attend the meetup on Monday! Which reminds me, I need to get my tickets..."

I don't feel like the assignments themselves were all that complicated, but with the addition of organizing group project ideas and implementations I think I'm starting to feel just a bit overwhelmed. But not by much (yet). A hot plate of food and a good night's rest is in order."
